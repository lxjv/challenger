I need a reason to talk about music, and this seems fun.
Shout out to Cate on the Hemispheric Views Discord for talking about music, which made me think about writing this post. [^1]

### Fontaines D.C. - Starburster
Starburster is the first single from Fontaines' latest album Romance [^2] and I've been listening to it constantly for the months it's been out. I love it so much.

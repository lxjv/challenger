            Hi! I'm an 18 year old music student from the UK, <br />
            writer, amateur programmer and leather jacket enthusiast.
        </p>

        <img

            class="u-photo profile-picture"

        I've been creative my entire life, but started writing to clear my head,
        about 3 years ago.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm learning a mix of <b>Rust</b> and <b>Typescript</b> right now, but I'm
        probably going to stick with Rust. <br />
        On the web side, I like <b>Eleventy</b> (it's what builds this site!).
    </p>

    <p>
        When I'm not knee-deep in my terminal, I like making music, taking
        photographs <br />
        and reading <strong>Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy</strong> for the 5th
        time.
    </p>

    <p>Feel free to walk around and see what's going on.</p>

    <p>
        If you want to keep in touch with me outside of this site, <br />
        I'm on the fediverse as <a href="https://social.lol/@la"
